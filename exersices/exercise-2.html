        <h2>
            Try the following exercises to perfect your knowledge. <br> <b>Your Challenge</b>
        </h2>

        <p>
            Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside.
            </li>

            <li>
                Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount. <br>
                If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console. <br>
                <strong> Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.</strong>
            </li>

            <p>
                Continuing from exercise above, let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday.
            </p>

            <li>
                Create a variable: const isHoliday = true; 
            </li>

            <li>
                Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must meet the age 
                requirement and it is also not a holiday.
            </li>

            <li>
                Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use 
                brackets () to control which code gets done first.
            </li>

            <li>
                Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.
            </li>

        </ol>
    </body>
