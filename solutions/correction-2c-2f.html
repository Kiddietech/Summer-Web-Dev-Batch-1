            Create a variable: const isHoliday = true; <br>
            Update the code so that in order to get a discount, 
            people must meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday. <br>
            Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets () to control which code gets done first. <br>
            Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.
        </p>

        <script>
            let age = 6; //enter value for age to see if display changes
            let isHoliday = true;

            if (isHoliday && (age < 7 || age > 64)) {
                console.log('Discount');
            } else {
                console.log('No discount');
            }
        </script>
